/*
//Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree,
// you are given two baskets, and your goal is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket.
 // The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type of fruit. //
 //You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 // You will pick one fruit from each tree until you cannot,
 // i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
  // //Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
  //Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'] //Output: 3

  //Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
  //Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']//Output: 5
  //Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket.
  //This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
